\chapter{Introduction}

\section{Preliminaries}

The subject of this dissertation is \textit{spectral graph theory}, which studies graphs through
various associated matrices, such as the adjacency matrix or normalized Laplacian.
We will address several problems in this area, with a common theme
of computing or maximizing a spectral parameter, such as the spectral radius, over some families of graphs.  
In this section, we provide an overview of the background terminology and results that will be used throughout the
dissertation, and establish notation.  The section concludes with a summary of the main results.


A graph $G$ is a pair $(V,E)$, where $E$ is a set of \textit{vertices} and $E$ is a set of unordered
pairs of vertices, which are called the \textit{edges} of $G$.  For clarity, we will often
use the notation $V = V(G)$ and $E = E(G)$.  A subgraph of $G$ is a graph whose vertex set and
edge set are subsets of $V(G)$ and $E(G)$ respectively.


Two vertices $x,y$ are said to be \textit{adjacent}
if the pair $(x,y)$ belongs to the edge set.  The \textit{neighbors} of a vertex $x$, denoted $N(x)$,
is the set of all vertices that are adjacent to $x$.  The \textit{degree} of a vertex $x$, denoted $d_x$,
is defined by $d_x = |N(x)|$.  The \textit{average degree} $d$ of a graph is then given by
\[ d = \sum_{x \in V(G)} d_x = \frac{2 |E(G)|}{|V(G)|}. \]

%\subsection{A Figure Example}

%This subsection shows a sample figure.

%  \caption[Short figure caption (must be \protect{$< 4$} lines in the list of figures)]{A picture of San Diego.  Note that figures must be on their own line (no neighboring text) and captions must be single-sp%aced and appear \protect\textit{below} the figure.  Captions can be as long as you want, but if they are longer than 4 lines in the list of figures, you must provide a short figure caption.\index{SanDiego}}

%\subsection{A Table Example}

%While in Section \ref{ssec:figure_example} Figure \ref{fig:sandiego} we had a majestic figure, here we provide a crazy table example.

Note that tables must be on their own line (no neighboring text) and captions must be single-spaced and appear \protect\textit{above} the table.  Captions can be as long as you want, but if they are longer than 4 lines in the list of figures, you must provide a short figure caption.}
